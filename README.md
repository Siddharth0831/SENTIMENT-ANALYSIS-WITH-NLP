*DESCRIPTION*: The second task involved performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews, classifying each review as positive or negative. We utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization combined with Logistic Regression.
We started by loading the review dataset and preprocessing the text dataâ€”cleaning HTML tags, removing special characters, and normalizing the text to improve the quality of input features. Then, we converted the text reviews into numerical feature vectors using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach, which captures the importance of words relative to the document corpus.
Using these vectors, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier, a simple yet effective model for binary classification tasks. The model was evaluated on a test set using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Our final model achieved strong performance with around 88% accuracy, indicating that the approach effectively captured sentiment from text data. This project provided hands-on experience in text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and applying logistic regression to solve practical sentiment classification problems.
